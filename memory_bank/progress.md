## Current Status

### Development Phase
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Status**: Production (limited use)
- **Users**: Author's family
- **Stability**: Good for intended use case

### Performance Metrics
- **Processing Time**: 10-30 minutes per book
- **Success Rate**: ~95% for Hungarian books
- **Memory Usage**: Up to 2GB for large books
- **API Costs**: $0.50-$2.00 per book

### Quality Metrics
- **OCR Accuracy**: High for clear scans
- **Cleanup Effectiveness**: Excellent for Hungarian
- **Output Readability**: Very good
- **Structure Preservation**: Good

## Known Issues

### Critical Issues
1. **Memory Exhaustion**: Large EPUBs can crash
   - Workaround: Use --save-interim flag
   - Status: Needs architectural change

2. **PDF URL Requirement**: Major usability issue
   - Workaround: Upload to cloud storage
   - Status: Blocked by Azure API design

### Major Issues
1. **Azure Costs**: Expensive for regular use
   - Workaround: Process in batches
   - Status: Awaiting local AI implementation

2. **Setup Complexity**: Azure configuration challenging
   - Workaround: Detailed documentation
   - Status: Simplified setup planned

### Minor Issues
1. **Progress Estimation**: Not always accurate
2. **Error Recovery**: Could be smarter
3. **Logging**: Could be more structured
4. **Testing**: Needs automated tests

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions (Project Start)
1. **Python Choice**: For rapid development ‚úÖ
2. **Azure Services**: For quality and Hungarian support ‚úÖ
3. **Two-stage Pipeline**: For flexibility ‚úÖ
4. **Command-line First**: For simplicity ‚úÖ

### Evolved Decisions
1. **URL-only Input**: Forced by Azure API ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Initially planned local file support
   - Had to adapt to API requirements

2. **Memory Management**: Added --save-interim üîÑ
   - Not in original design
   - Added after memory issues discovered

3. **Hungarian Focus**: Strengthened over time üìà
   - Started as general tool
   - Optimized specifically for Hungarian

### Future Direction Changes
1. **Local AI Priority**: Response to Azure costs üéØ
   - Originally planned to stay with Azure
   - Community feedback changed priority

2. **Open Source Focus**: Emphasis on contributions ü§ù
   - Started as personal project
   - Now actively seeking contributors
